This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

application_record <- read.csv("application_record.csv")
head(application_record)

credit_record <- read.csv("credit_record.csv")
head(credit_record)

table(credit_record$STATUS)

summary(credit_record)

record <- merge(application_record, credit_record, by = "ID")
head(record)

record$NO_OVERDUE <- record$STATUS == "C"
record$NO_LOAN <- record$STATUS == "X"
record$ABS_DAYS_EMPLOYED <- abs(record$DAYS_EMPLOYED)

head(record)
summary(record)

ggplot(record, aes(x = AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, fill = factor(NO_OVERDUE))) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab(label = "Number of idk") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of idk") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(record, aes(x = AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, fill = factor(NO_LOAN))) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab(label = "Number of idk") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of idk") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
